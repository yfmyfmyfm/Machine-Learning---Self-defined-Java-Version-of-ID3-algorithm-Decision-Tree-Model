In this project, I used JAVA to generate an ID3 algorithm of building decision tree. To be more precise, the main processes are as following:

1. Self define function readData in file dtlearn.java to read ".arff" data. We have 2 pairs of data as testcases, one pair is diabetes_train.arff and diabetes_test.arff, the other is heart_train.arff and heart_test.arff. The first step of the project is to self build function to read data in .arff files.
2. generate decision tree data structure in class named DecisionTreeNode in file DecisionTreeNode.java
3. implement ID3 algorithm and its prediction in dtlearn.java
